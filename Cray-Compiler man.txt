IMPLEMENTATION
     Cray Linux Environment (CLE)

DESCRIPTION
     The cc command invokes the Cray C compiler. The compiler conforms to
     the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 and to the American National Standards Institute
     (ANSI) X3.159-1989 standards.

     Typically, the cc command processes the source files named on the
     command line, generates a binary object file (sourcefile.o), links the
     binary object file, and generates an executable file (named a.out by
     default). Other files used and created by the C compiler are discussed
     under the FILES section.

     For a more detailed description of the cc command, see the Cray C and
     C++ Reference Manual. Information contained in this man page may
     differ from the reference manual. Where the information differs, this
     man page supersedes the information contained in the reference manual.

   Conflicting Options
     If you specify conflicting options, the option specified last on the
     command line overrides the previously specified option. Exceptions to
     this rule are noted in the individual option descriptions.

   Conflicts between Options and #pragma Directives
     Most #pragma directives override corresponding command-line options.
     Exceptions to this rule are noted in option or #pragma directive
     descriptions.

   Arguments to the -h Option
     The arguments to the -h option can be used to direct specific compiler
     actions. To specify more than one argument, separate individual
     arguments with commas but without intervening spaces.

   Command-line Options
     The cc command accepts the following options, which are grouped
     according to functionality.

   Standard Conformance Language Options
     -h [no]c99
               Enables or disables language features new to the C99
               standard and Cray C compiler, while providing support for
               features that were previously defined as Cray extensions. If
               the previous implementation of the Cray extension differed
               from the C99 standard, both implementations will be
               available when the -h c99 option is enabled. The -h c99
               option is also required for C99 features not previously
               supported as extensions.

               When -h noc99 is used, C99 language features such as
               variable-length arrays (VLAs) and restricted pointers that
               were available as extensions previously to adoption of the
               C99 standard remain available to you.

               The default is -h c99.

     -h [no]conform, -h [no]stdc
               Specify strict conformance to the ISO C standard. The
               defaults are -h noconform and -h nostdc. The -h noconform
               and -h nostdc options specify partial conformance to the
               standard.

               Note:  By default, the compiler calls the Cray mathlib
               versions of intrinsic functions (abs, cos, exp, for example)
               which do not set errno and do not raise IEEE-754 underflow
               exceptions. If -hconform is specified, the compiler calls
               the stdc glibc versions of the runtime intrinsic functions.

     -h [no]tolerant
               Allows the use of older, less standard C constructs, thereby
               making it easier to port code written for previous C
               compilers. Errors involving comparisons or assignments of
               pointers and integers become warnings. The compiler
               generates casts so that the types agree. With -h notolerant,
               the compiler is intolerant of the older constructs.

               The -h tolerant option causes the compiler to tolerate
               accessing an object with one type through a pointer to an
               entirely different type. For example, a pointer to a long
               might be used to access an object declared with type double.
               Such references violate the C standard and should be
               eliminated if possible. They can reduce the effectiveness of
               alias analysis and inhibit optimization.

               The default is -h notolerant.

     -h [no]gnu
               Enables the compiler to recognize a subset of the GCC
               version 4.4.4 extensions to C listed in the GCC C Language
               Extensions table.

               The default is -h nognu.

               Special files such as /dev/null may be used as source files.

   Table 1. General Language Options
     -h restrict=args
               Globally tells the compiler to treat certain classes of
               pointers as restricted pointers. You can use this option to
               enhance optimizations (this includes vectorization).

               Classes of affected pointers are determined by the value
               contained in args, as follows:

             --------------------------------------------------------------
             args         Description
             --------------------------------------------------------------
             a            All pointers to object and incomplete types are
                          to be considered restricted pointers, regardless
                          of where they appear in the source code. This
                          includes pointers in class, struct, and union
                          declarations, type casts, function prototypes,
                          and so on.
             f            All function parameters that are pointers to
                          objects or incomplete types can be treated as
                          restricted pointers.
             --------------------------------------------------------------

          Caution:

                    Do not specify restrict=a if, during execution of any
                    function, an object is modified and that object is
                    referenced through either two different pointers or
                    through the declared name of the object and a pointer.
                    Undefined behavior may result.

                    Do not specify restrict=f if, during execution of any
                    function, an object is modified and that object is
                    referenced through either two different pointer
                    function parameters or through the declared name of the
                    object and a pointer function parameter. Undefined
                    behavior may result.

               The args arguments tell the compiler to assume that in the
               current compilation unit each pointer (=a) or each pointer
               that is a function parameter (=f) points to a unique object.
               This assumption eliminates those pointers as sources of
               potential aliasing and may allow additional vectorization or
               other optimizations. These options cause only data
               dependencies from pointer aliasing to be ignored, rather
               than all data dependencies, so they can be used safely.

          Caution:

                    The arguments make assertions about your program that,
                    if incorrect, can introduce undefined behavior. You
                    should not use -h restrict=a if, during the execution
                    of any function, an object is modified and that object
                    is referenced through either of the following:

                    ·  Two different pointers

                    ·  The declared name of the object and a pointer

                    The -h restrict=f option is subject to the analogous
                    restriction, with "function parameter pointer"
                    replacing "pointer."

     -h [no]calchars
               Allows the use of the $ character in identifier names. This
               option is useful for porting codes in which identifiers
               include this character. With -h nocalchars, this character
               is not allowed in identifier names.

               The default is -h nocalchars.

          Caution:

                    Use this option with extreme care, because identifiers
                    with this character are within CNL name space and are
                    included in many library identifiers, internal compiler
                    labels, objects, and functions. You must prevent
                    conflicts between any of these uses, current or future,
                    and identifier declarations or references in your code;
                    any such conflict is an error.

     -h [no]signedshifts
               Affects the result of the right shift operator. For the
               expression e1 >> e2 where e1 has a signed type, when
               -h signedshifts is in effect, the vacated bits are filled
               with the sign bit of e1. When -h nosignedshifts is in
               effect, the vacated bits are filled with zeros, identical to
               the behavior when e1 has an unsigned type.

               The default is -h nosignedshifts.

   General Optimization Options
     -h [no]add_paren
               Forces the compiler to evaluate selected associative
               operations (+,-,*) from left to right if the result type is
               float or complex. Left to right evaluation is not required
               by the language standards, but some applications may expect
               it.

               The default is -h noadd_paren.

     -h [no]aggress
               Provides greater opportunity to optimize loops that would
               otherwise by inhibited from optimization due to an internal
               compiler size limitation. -h noaggress leaves this size
               limitation in effect.

               With -h aggress, internal compiler tables are expanded to
               accommodate larger loop bodies. This option can increase the
               compilation's time and memory size.

               The default is -h noaggress.

     -h [no]autoprefetch
               Controls automatic prefetch optimization. Does not affect
               loop_info [no]prefetch directive.

               Default: autoprefetch.

     -h [no]autothread
               Enables or disables automatic threading. The default is -h
               noautothread.

     -h display_opt
               Displays the current optimization settings for this
               compilation.

     -h flex_mp=level
               Controls the aggressiveness of optimizations which may
               affect floating point and complex repeatability when
               application requirements require identical results when
               varying the number of ranks or threads. The default is -h
               flex_mp=default.

               The values for level are:

   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   level                   Description
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   intolerant              Has the highest probability of repeatable
                           results, but also the highest performance
                           penalty.
   strict                  Uses some safe optimizations and yields higher
                           performance than intolerant, with a high
                           probability of repeatable results.
   conservative            Uses more aggressive optimization and yields
                           higher performance than strict, but results may
                           not be sufficiently repeatable for some
                           applications.
   default                 Uses more aggressive optimization and yields
                           higher performance than conservative, but
                           results may not be sufficiently repeatable for
                           some applications.
   tolerant                Uses most aggressive optimization and yields
                           highest performance, but results may not be
                           sufficiently repeatable for some applications.
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

     -h fusionn
               Controls loop fusion and changes the assertiveness of the
               fusion pragma. Loop fusion can improve the performance of
               loops, although in rare cases it may degrade performance.
               The n argument allows you to turn loop fusion on or off and
               determine where fusion should occur.

               Note:  Loop fusion is disabled when the scalar level is set
               to 0.

               The default is -h fusion2.

               The values for n are:

             --------------------------------------------------------------
             n            Description
             --------------------------------------------------------------
             0            No fusion (ignore all fusion pragmas and do not
                          attempt to fuse other loops)
             1            Attempt to fuse loops that are marked by the
                          fusion pragma.
             2            Attempt to fuse all loops (includes array syntax
                          implied loops), except those marked with the
                          nofusion pragma.
             --------------------------------------------------------------

     -h [no]intrinsics
               Allows the use of intrinsic hardware functions, which allow
               direct access to some hardware instructions or generate
               inline code for some functions. This option has no effect on
               specially handled library functions.

               The default is -h intrinsics.

               See the Cray C and C++ Reference Manual for a complete list
               of hardware intrinsic functions.

     -h loop_trips=[tiny|small|medium|large|huge]
               Specifies runtime loop trip counts for all loops in a
               compiled source file. This information is used to better
               tune optimizations to the runtime characteristics of the
               application.

     -h mpin   Enables or disables optimization of MPI operations. -h mpi1
               enables this option.

               In the CCS environment, -h mpi1 is not supported.

               The default is -h mpi0.

     -h [no]msgs
               Causes the compiler to write optimization messages to
               stderr.

               When the -h msgs option is in effect, you may request that a
               listing be produced so that you can see the optimization
               messages in the listing. For information about obtaining
               listings, see -h list=opt.

               The default is -h nomsgs.

     -h [no]negmsgs
               Causes the compiler to generate messages to stderr that
               indicate why optimizations such as vectorization or inlining
               did not occur in a given instance.

               The -h negmsgs option enables the -h msgs option. The -h
               list=a option enables the -h negmsgs option.

               The default is -h nonegmsgs.

     -h [no]overindex
               Declares that there are array subscripts that index a
               dimension of an array that is outside the declared bounds of
               that array. The -h nooverindex option declares that there
               are no array subscripts that index a dimension of an array
               that is outside the declared bounds of that array.

               The default is -h nooverindex.

     -h [no]pattern
               Globally enables or disables pattern matching. Pattern
               matching is on by default.

               When the compiler recognizes certain patterns in the source
               code, it replaces the construct with a call to an optimized
               library routine. A loop or statement that has been pattern
               matched and replaced with a call to a library routine is
               indicated with an A in the loopmark listing.

               Note:  Pattern matching is not always worthwhile. If there
               is a small amount of work in the pattern-matched construct,
               the call overhead may outweigh the time saved by using the
               optimized library routine. When compiling using the default
               optimization settings, the compiler attempts to determine
               whether each given candidate for pattern matching will in
               fact yield improved performance.

     -h pl=program_library
               Create and use a persistent repository of compiler
               information specified by program_library. When used with -h
               wp, this option provides application-wide, cross-file,
               automatic inlining. See -h wp.

               The program_library repository is implemented as a directory
               and the information contained in program library is built up
               with each compiler invocation. Any compilation that does not
               have the -hpl option will not add information to this
               repository.

               Because of the persistence of program_library, it is the
               user's responsibility to manage it. For example, rm -r
               program_library might be added to the make clean target in
               an application makefile. Because program_library is a
               directory, use rm -r to remove it.

               If an application makefile works by creating files in
               multiple directories during a single build, the
               program_library should be an absolute path, otherwise
               multiple and incomplete program library repositories will be
               created. For example, avoid -hpl=./PL.1 and use
               -hpl=/fullpath/builddir/PL.1 instead.

     -h threadn
               Controls the compilation and optimization of OpenMP
               directives and autothreading, where n is a value from 0 to 3
               with 0 being off and 3 specifying the most aggressive
               optimization.

               The default is -h thread2.

               The values for n are:

             --------------------------------------------------------------
             n            Description
             --------------------------------------------------------------
             0            No autothreading or OMP threading. The thread0
                          option is similar to -h noomp, but -h noomp
                          disables OpenMP only and does not affect
                          autothreading.
             1            Specifies strict compliance with the OpenMP
                          standard for directive compilation. Strict
                          compliance is defined as no extra optimizations
                          in or around OpenMP constructs. In other words,
                          the compiler performs only the requested
                          optimizations.
             2            OpenMP parallel regions are subjected to some
                          optimizations; that is, some parallel region
                          expansion. Parallel region expansion is an
                          optimization that merges two adjacent parallel
                          regions in a compilation unit into a single
                          parallel region.
             3            Full optimization: loop restructuring, including
                          modifying iteration space for static schedules
                          (breaking standard compliance). Reduction results
                          may not be repeatable.
             --------------------------------------------------------------

     -h unrolln
               Globally controls loop unrolling and changes the
               assertiveness of the unroll pragma. By default, the compiler
               attempts to unroll all loops, unless the nounroll pragma is
               specified for a loop. Generally, unrolling loops increases
               single processor performance at the cost of increased
               compile time and code size.

               The n argument allows you to turn loop unrolling on or off
               and specify where unrolling should occur. It also affects
               the assertiveness of the unroll pragma.

               The default is -h unroll2.

               The values for n are:

             --------------------------------------------------------------
             n            Description
             --------------------------------------------------------------
             0            No unrolling (ignore all unroll pragmas and do
                          not attempt to unroll other loops).
             1            Attempt to unroll loops that are marked by the
                          unroll pragma.
             2            Unroll loops when performance is expected to
                          improve. Loops marked with the unroll or nounroll
                          pragma override automatic unrolling.
             --------------------------------------------------------------

               Note:  Loop unrolling is disabled when the scalar level is
               set to 0.

     -h wp     Enables the whole program mode. This option causes the
               compiler backend (IPA, optimizer, codegenerator) to be
               invoked at application link time, enabling whole program
               automatic inlining/cloning and future whole program
               interprocedural analysis (IPA) optimizations. Since the -hwp
               option provides automatic application-wide inlining, the
               -Oipafrom option is no longer needed for cross-file inlining
               and using these two options together is not permitted.
               Requires that pl=program_library is also specified. See -h
               pl=program_library.

               The options -h pl=program_library and -hwp should be
               specified on all compiler invocations and on the compiler
               link invocation. Since -hwp delays the compiler optimization
               step until link time, -c compiles will take less time and
               the link step will take longer. Normally, this is just a
               time shift from one build phase to another with roughly the
               same overall compile time. In some cases increased inlining
               may cause an increase in overall compile time. Using -hwp
               allows the compiler backend to be invoked in parallel during
               a build. Setting the environment variable NPROC controls the
               number of concurrent compiler backend invocations and this
               parallelism may reduce overall compile time.

     -O level  Specifies the optimization level for a group of compiler
               features. Specifying -O with no argument is the same as not
               specifying the -O level option; this syntax is supported for
               compatibility with other vendors.

               The level values 0, 1, 2, and 3 enable you to specify
               increasing general levels of optimization.

               The -O 1, -O 2, and -O 3 specifications do not directly
               correspond to the numeric optimization levels for scalar
               optimization and vectorization. For example, specifying -O 3
               does not necessarily enable scalar3 and vector3. Cray
               reserves the right to alter the specific optimizations
               performed at these levels from release to release. You can
               use the -h display_opt option to display the optimization
               options used during compilation.

               The valid level values are:

               level     Optimization Provided

               -O 0      Disables all optimizations including floating
                         point optimizations. Implies -h fp0.

               -O 1, -O 2, -O 3

               The default optimization level is 2.

               See the Cray C and C++ Reference Manual for the -O and -h
               equivalent values.

   Performance Analysis Options
     -h [no]func_trace
               For use only with CrayPat. If this option is specified, the
               compiler inserts CrayPat trace entry points into each
               function in the compiled source file. The names of the trace
               entry points are:

               ·  __pat_tp_func_entry

               ·  __pat_tp_func_return

               These are resolved by CrayPat when the program is
               instrumented using the pat_build command. When the
               instrumented program is executed and it encounters either of
               these trace entry points, CrayPat captures the address of
               the current function and its return address.

     -h gasp[=opt[:opt]]
               Request GASP (Global Address Space Performance Analysis)
               instrumentation. With no options specified, remote data
               accesses are profiled. When opt is specified, the compiler
               provides additional instrumentation as follows:

               ·  local

                  Enables instrumentation of events generated by shared
                  local accesses. Instrumenting these events can add
                  runtime overhead to the application.

               ·  functions

                  Enables function instrumentation. Sets -hipa0

               #pragma pupc [on|off] has no effect in the current GASP
               implementation.

     -h keepfiles
               Prevents the removal of the object (.o) and temporary
               assembly (.s) files after an executable is created.
               Normally, the compiler automatically removes these files
               after linking them to create an executable. Since the
               original object files are required to instrument a program
               for performance analysis, if you plan to use CrayPat to
               conduct performance analysis experiments, you can use this
               option to preserve the object files.

     -h keep_frame_pointer
               Retain call stack information back to main entry point for
               CrayPat performance sampling.

               The default is off.

     -h [no]omp_trace
               Turns the insertion of the CrayPat OpenMP tracing calls on
               and off.

               The default is -h noomp_trace; tracing is off.

     -h profile_generate
               Directs that the source code be instrumented for gathering
               profile information. The compiler inserts calls and data-
               gathering instructions to allow CrayPat to gather
               information about the loops in a compilation unit. If you
               use this option, you must run CrayPat on the resulting
               executable so the CrayPat data-gathering routines are linked
               in.

   Automatic Cache Management Options
     -h cachen Specifies the levels of automatic cache management to
               perform.

               The default is -h cache2.

               The values for n are:

             --------------------------------------------------------------
             n            Description
             --------------------------------------------------------------
             0            Cache blocking (including directive-based
                          blocking) is turned off. This level is compatible
                          with all scalar and vector optimization levels.
             1            Conservative automatic cache management.
                          Characteristics include moderate compile time.
                          Symbols are placed in the cache when the
                          possibility of cache reuse exists and the
                          predicted cache footprint of the symbol in
                          isolation is small enough to experience the
                          reuse.
             2            Moderately aggressive automatic cache management.
                          Characteristics include moderate compile time.
                          Symbols are placed in the cache when the
                          possibility of cache reuse exists and the
                          predicted state of the cache model is such that
                          the symbol will experience the reuse.
             3            Aggressive automatic cache management.
                          Characteristics include potentially high compile
                          time. Symbols are placed in the cache when the
                          possibility of cache reuse exists and the
                          allocation of the symbol to the cache is
                          predicted to increase the number of cache hits.
             --------------------------------------------------------------

               For more information on automatic cache management, see the
               Cray C and C++ Reference Manual.

   Vector Optimization Options
     -h vectorn
               Specifies the level of automatic vectorizing to be
               performed. Vectorization results in dramatic performance
               improvements with a small increase in object code size.
               Vectorization directives are unaffected by this option.

               The default is -h vector2.

               The values of n are:

             --------------------------------------------------------------
             n            Description
             --------------------------------------------------------------
             0            No automatic vectorization. Characteristics
                          include low compile time and small compile size.
                          This option is compatible with all scalar
                          optimization levels.
             1            Specifies conservative vectorization.
                          Characteristics include moderate compile time and
                          size.
                          The -h vector1 option is compatible with
                          -h scalar1, -h scalar2, and -h scalar3.
             2            Specifies moderate vectorization. Characteristics
                          include moderate compile time and size. Loop
                          nests are restructured.
                          The -h vector2 option is compatible with
                          -h scalar2 or -h scalar3.
             3            Specifies aggressive vectorization.
             --------------------------------------------------------------

               For more information about vectorization directives, see the
               Cray C and C++ Reference Manual.

   Inlining Optimization Options
     -h ipan   Allows the compiler to automatically decide which procedures
               to consider for inlining. Procedures that are potential
               targets for inline expansion include all the procedures
               within the input file to the compilation.

             --------------------------------------------------------------
             Inlining
             level        Description
             --------------------------------------------------------------
             0            All interprocedural analysis and optimizations
                          disabled. All inlining and cloning compiler
                          directives are ignored.
             1            Directive IPA. Inlining/cloning is attempted for
                          call sites and routines that are under the
                          control of a compiler directive.
             2            Inlining. Inline a call site to an arbitrary
                          depth as long as the expansion does not exceed
                          some compiler-determined threshold. The call site
                          must flatten for any expansion to occur. The call
                          site is said to "flatten" when there are no calls
                          present in the expanded code. The call site must
                          reside within the body of a loop and the entire
                          loop body must flatten. A loop body is said to
                          "flatten" when all call sites within the body of
                          the loop are flattened. Includes level 1.
             3            Constant actual argument inlining and tiny
                          routine inlining. This includes levels 1 and 2,
                          plus any call site that contains a constant
                          actual argument. Additionally, any call nest
                          (regardless of location) that is below some small
                          compiler-determined threshold will be inlined
                          provided that call nest completely flattens.
             4            Aggressive inlining. This includes levels 1, 2,
                          and 3, plus a call site does not have to reside
                          in a loop body to inline nor does the call site
                          have to necessarily flatten.
             5            Cloning. Includes levels 1, 2, 3, 4, plus routine
                          cloning is attempted if inlining fails at a given
                          call site.
             --------------------------------------------------------------

               The default is -h ipa3.

     -h ipafrom=source[:source] ...
               Allows you to explicitly indicate the procedures to consider
               for inline expansion. The source arguments identify each
               file or directory that contains the routines to consider for
               inlining. Whenever a call is encountered in the input
               program that matches a routine in source, inlining is
               attempted for that call site.

               Note:  Spaces are not allowed on either side of the equal
               sign.

               All inlining directives are recognized with explicit
               inlining.

               Note:  The routines in source are not actually linked with
               the final program. They are simply templates for the
               inliner. To have a routine contained in source linked with
               the program, you must include it in an input file to the
               compilation.

               Use one or more of the following objects in the source
               argument:

               C source files
                         The routines in C source files are candidates for
                         inline expansion and must contain error-free code.

               dir       A directory that contains any of the C file types.

               For a description of combined inlining, see the Cray C and
               C++ Reference Manual.

   Scalar Optimization Options
     -h [no]concurrent
               Equivalent to adding a concurrent pragma before every loop
               in the file, including loops created from array syntax. This
               option may provide significant performance improvements for
               some codes. The user must ensure that all loops are clearly
               parallel; private arrays, ambiguous reductions and other
               special forms may not yield valid parallel code in this
               mode. -hnoconcurrent honors existing concurrent pragmas.

               The default is -hnoconcurrent.

     -h [no]interchange
               Allows the compiler to attempt to interchange all loops, a
               technique that is used to gain performance by having the
               compiler swap an inner loop with an outer loop. The compiler
               attempts the interchange only if the interchange will
               increase performance. Loop interchange is performed only at
               scalar optimization level 2 or higher.

               The -h nointerchange option prevents the compiler from
               attempting to interchange any loops. To disable interchange
               of loops individually, use the #pragma _CRI nointerchange
               directive.

               The default is -h interchange.

     -h scalarn
               Specifies the level of automatic scalar optimization to be
               performed. Scalar optimization directives are unaffected by
               this option.

               The default is -h scalar2.

               The values for n are:

             --------------------------------------------------------------
             n            Description
             --------------------------------------------------------------
             0            Minimal automatic scalar optimization. The
                          -h zeroinc option is implied by -h scalar0.
             1            Conservative automatic scalar optimization. This
                          level implies -h nozeroinc.
             2            Aggressive automatic scalar optimization. The
                          scalar optimizations that provide the best
                          application performance are used, with some
                          limitations imposed to allow for faster
                          compilation times.
             3            Very aggressive optimization: compilation times
                          may increase significantly.
             --------------------------------------------------------------

     -h [no]zeroinc
               Improves run time performance by causing the compiler to
               assume that constant increment variables (CIVs) in loops are
               not incremented by expressions with a value of 0.

               This option causes the compiler to assume that some constant
               increment variables (CIVs) in loops might be incremented by
               0 for each pass through the loop, preventing generation of
               optimized code.

               For example, in a loop with index i, the expression expr in
               the statement i += expr can evaluate to 0. This rarely
               happens in actual code. -h zeroinc is the safer and slower
               option. This option is affected by the -h scalarn option.

               The default is -h nozeroinc.

   Math Options
     -h fpn    Allows you to control the level of floating-point and
               complex arithmetic optimizations. The n argument controls
               the level of allowable optimization; 0 gives the compiler
               minimum freedom to optimize floating-point and complex
               operations , while 4 gives it maximum freedom. The higher
               the level, the lesser the floating-point operations conform
               to the IEEE standard.

               Generally, this is the behavior and usage for each -h fp
               level:

               ·  The -h fp0 causes your program's executable code to
                  conform more closely to the IEEE floating-point standard
                  than the default mode (-h fp2). When you specify this
                  level, many identity optimizations are disabled,
                  vectorization of floating-point and complex reductions
                  are disabled, executable code is slower than higher
                  floating-point optimization levels. Use the -h fp0 option
                  only when your code pushes the limits of IEEE accuracy or
                  requires strong IEEE standard conformance.

               ·  The -h fp1 option performs various generally safe, non-
                  conforming IEEE optimizations, such as folding a == a to
                  true, where a is a floating point object. At this level,
                  a scaled complex divide mechanism is enabled that
                  increases the range of complex values that can be handled
                  without producing an underflow, and rewrite of division
                  into multiplication by reciprocal is inhibited. You
                  should never use the -h fp1 option except when your code
                  pushes the limits of IEEE accuracy or requires strong
                  IEEE standard conformance.

               ·  The -h fp2 option includes optimizations of -h fp1.

               ·  The -h fp3 option includes optimizations of -h fp2. You
                  should use the -h fp3 option when performance is more
                  critical than the level of IEEE standard conformance
                  provided by -h fp2. The -h fp3 option is an acceptable
                  level of optimization for many applications.

               ·  The -h fp4 option includes optimizations of -h fp3. You
                  should only use -h fp4 if your application uses
                  algorithms which are tolerant of reduced precision.

               The Floating-point Optimization Levels table compares the
               various optimization levels of the -h fp option The table
               lists some of the optimizations performed; the compiler may
               perform other optimizations not listed.

   Table 2. Debugging Options
     -g        Identical to specifying the -G0 option.

     -G level  Enables the generation of debugging information used by
               symbolic debuggers. These options allow debugging with
               breakpoints.

                       Table 3. -G level Definitions
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 level  Optimization  Breakpoints allowed on  Debugging  Execution speed
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -Gn    None          Every executable        Best        Limited

 -Gp    Partial       Block boundaries        Better      Better

 -G3                  statement               requires
                                              fast-track
                                              debugger
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------

               Better debugging information comes at the cost of inhibiting
               certain optimization techniques, so choose the option that
               best fits the debugging needs of any particular source file
               in an application.

               The -g option is equivalent to -G0. The -g option is
               included for compatibility with earlier versions of the
               compiler and many other UNIX systems; the -G option is the
               preferred specification. The -G0 and -g options disable most
               optimizations and imply -h fp0.

               The -G3 option permits both full code optimization and the
               greatest flexibility in setting breakpoints, but requires
               use of the Cray fast-track debugger. For more information,
               see the lgdb(1) man page.

               The debugging options take precedence over any conflicting
               options that appear on the command line. If more than one
               debugging option appears, the last one specified overrides
               the others.

     -h [no]bounds
               Provides checking of pointer and array references to ensure
               that they are within acceptable boundaries. -h nobounds
               disables these checks.

               For each dimension, the checks verify that the subscript is
               greater than or equal to 0 and less than the upper bound.
               For pointers, the upper bound is computed based on the
               amount of the memory on the node. This amount is scaled at
               runtime by the number of UPC threads in the job for UPC
               pointers-to-shared with definite blocksize. For arrays, the
               (possibly implicit) declared upper bound of the dimension is
               used. If the dimension is the THREADS-scaled dimension of a
               UPC shared array with definite blocksize, the upper bound
               for the check is computed at runtime based on the number of
               UPC threads in the job.

     -h dir_check
               Enables directive checking at run time. Errors detected at
               compile time are reported during compilation and so are not
               reported at run time. The following directives are checked:
               shortloop, shortloop128, collapse, and the loop_info clauses
               min_trips and max_trips. Violation of a run time check
               results in an immediate fatal error diagnostic.

          Warning:

                    Optimization of enclosing and adjacent loops is
                    degraded when run time directive checking is enabled.
                    This capability, though useful for debugging, is not
                    recommended for production runs.

     -h zero   Causes stack-allocated memory to be initialized to all
               zeros.

   Compiler Message Options
     -h msglevel_n
               Specifies the lowest level of severity of messages to be
               issued. Messages at the specified level and above are
               issued.

               The default is -h msglevel_3.

               Values for n are:

             --------------------------------------------------------------
             n            Description
             --------------------------------------------------------------
             0            Comment
             1            Note
             2            Caution
             3            Warning
             4            Error
             --------------------------------------------------------------

     -h [no]message=n[:n...]
               Enables or disables specified compiler messages, where n is
               the number of a message to be enabled or disabled. You can
               specify more than one message number; multiple numbers must
               be separated by a colon with no intervening spaces. For
               example, to disable messages CC-1trunk and CC-9, specify:

               -h nomessage=174:9

               The -h [no]message=n option overrides -h msglevel_n for the
               specified messages. If n is not a valid message number, it
               is ignored. Any compiler message except ERROR, INTERNAL, and
               LIMIT messages can be disabled; attempts to disable these
               messages by using the -h nomessage=n option are ignored.

     -h report=args
               Generates report messages specified in args and lets you
               direct the specified messages to a file. The values of args
               are:

             --------------------------------------------------------------
             args         Description
             --------------------------------------------------------------
             f            Writes specified messages to file.V, where file
                          is the source file specified on the command line.
                          If the f option is not specified, messages are
                          written to stderr.
             i            Generates inlining optimization messages.
             s            Generates scalar optimization messages.
             v            Generates vector optimization messages.
             --------------------------------------------------------------

               No spaces are allowed around the equal sign (=) or any of
               the args codes. For example, the following example prints
               inlining and scalar optimization messages for myfile.c:

               % cc -h report=is myfile.c

     -h [no]abort
               Controls whether a compilation aborts if an error is
               detected.

               The default is -h noabort.

     -h errorlimit[=n]
               Specifies the maximum number of error messages the compiler
               prints before it exits, where n is a positive integer.
               Specifying -h errorlimit=0 disables exiting on the basis of
               the number of errors. Specifying -h errorlimit with no
               qualifier is the same as setting n to 1.

               The default is -h errorlimit=100.

   Compilation Phase Options
     -E        Directs the compiler to execute only the preprocessor phase
               of the compiler. The -E and -P options are equivalent,
               except that -E directs output to stdout and inserts
               appropriate #line linenumber preprocessing directives. The
               -E option takes precedence over the -h feonly, -S, and -c
               options.

     -P        Directs the compiler to execute only the preprocessor phase
               of the compiler for each source file specified. The
               preprocessed output for each source file is written to a
               file with a name that corresponds to the name of the source
               file and has a .i suffix substituted for the suffix of the
               source file. The -P option is similar to the -E option,
               except that #line linenumber directives are suppressed, and
               the preprocessed source does not go to stdout. This option
               takes precedence over -h feonly, -S, and -c.

               When both the -P and -E options are specified, the last one
               specified takes precedence.

     -h feonly Limits the compiler to syntax checking. The optimizer and
               code generator are not executed. This option takes
               precedence over -S and -c.

     -S        Compiles the named source files and leaves the assembly
               language output in the corresponding files suffixed with a
               .s. If this option is used with -G or -g, debugging
               information is not generated. This option takes precedence
               over -c.

     -c        Creates a relocatable object file for each named source file
               but does not link the object files. The relocatable object
               file name corresponds to the name of the source file. The .o
               suffix is substituted for the suffix of the source file.

     -#        Produces output indicating each phase of the compilation as
               it is executed. Each succeeding output line overwrites the
               previous line.

     -##       Produces output indicating each phase of the compilation as
               it is executed.

     -###      The same as -##, except the compilation phases are not
               executed.

     -W phase,"opt..."
               Passes arguments directly to a phase of the compiling
               system.

               The values of phase are:

           ----------------------------------------------------------------
           phase                 System Phase          Command
           ----------------------------------------------------------------
           0 (zero)              Compiler              cc
           a                     Assembler             as
           l                     Linker                ld
           P                     Preprocessor          cc
           ----------------------------------------------------------------

               Arguments to be passed to system phases can be entered in
               either of two styles. If spaces appear within a string to be
               passed, the string is enclosed in double quotes. When double
               quotes are not used, spaces cannot appear in the string.
               Commas can appear wherever spaces normally appear; an option
               and its argument can be either separated by a comma or not
               separated. If a comma is part of an argument, it must be
               preceded by the \ character. For example, any of the
               following command lines would send -e name to the linker:

               % cc -Wl,"-e name" file.c

               % cc -Wl,-e,name file.c

               % cc -Wl,"-ename" file.c

               Because the preprocessor is built into the compiler, -Wp and
               -W0 are equivalent.

               The -Wl,-rpath ldir linker option changes the runtime
               library search algorithm to look for files in directory
               ldir. To request more than one library directory, specify
               multiple -rpath options. Note that a library may be found at
               link time with a -L option, but may not be found at run time
               if a corresponding -rpath option is not found. Also note
               that the compiler driver does not pass the -rpath option to
               the linker. You must explicitly specify -Wl when using this
               option.

          Caution:

                    At link time, all ldir arguments are added to the
                    executable. The dynamic linker will search these paths
                    first for shared dynamic libraries at runtime, with one
                    exception. The Linux environment variable
                    LD_LIBRARY_PATH precedes all other search paths for
                    shared dynamically linked libraries. The use of
                    LD_LIBRARY_PATH is discouraged because it will change
                    the shared dynamically linked library search paths for
                    all executable files in your environment.

     -Y phase,dirname
               Specifies a new directory (dirname) from which the
               designated phase should be executed. The values of phase
               are:

           ----------------------------------------------------------------
           phase                 System phase          Command
           ----------------------------------------------------------------
           0 (zero)              Compiler              cc

           l                     Linker                ld
           ----------------------------------------------------------------

               Because there is no separate preprocessor, -Yp and -Y0 are
               equivalent.

   Preprocessing Options
     -C        Retains all comments in the preprocessed source code, except
               those on preprocessor directive lines. By default, the
               preprocessor phase strips comments from the source code.
               This option is useful in combination with the -P or -E
               option.

     -D macro[=def]
               Defines macro as if it were defined by a #define directive.
               If no =def argument is specified, macro is defined as 1.

               Predefined macros also exist and are described in the Cray C
               and C++ Reference Manual. Any predefined macro except those
               required by the standard can be redefined by the -D option.
               The -U option overrides the -D option when the same macro
               name is specified, regardless of the order of options on the
               command line.

     -h [no]pragma=name[:name ...]
               Enables or disables the processing of specified directives
               in the source code, where name can be the name of a
               directive or a word shown in the following table to specify
               a group of directives. More than one name can be specified.
               Multiple names must be separated by a colon and have no
               intervening spaces.

           ----------------------------------------------------------------

               When using this option to enable or disable individual
               directives, note that some directives must occur in pairs.
               For these directives, you must disable both directives if
               you want to disable either; otherwise, the disabling of one
               of the directives may cause errors when the other directive
               is (or is not) present in the compilation unit.

               By default, no directives are disabled.

     -I incldir
               Specifies a directory for files named in #include directives
               when the #include file names do not have a specified path.
               Each directory specified must be specified by a separate -I
               option.

               The order in which directories are searched for files named
               on #include directives is determined by enclosing the file
               name in either quotation marks ("") or angle brackets (< and
               >).

               Directories for #include "file" are searched in the
               following order:

               1. Directory of the input file.

               2. Directories named in -I options, in command-line order.

               3. Site-specific and compiler release-specific include files
                  directories.

               4. Directory /usr/include.

               Directories for #include <file> are searched in the
               following order:

               1. Directories named in -I options, in command-line order.

               2. Site-specific and compiler release-specific include files
                  directories.

               3. Directory /usr/include.

               If the -I option specifies a directory name that does not
               begin with a slash (/), the directory is interpreted as
               relative to the current working directory and not relative
               to the directory of the input file (if different from the
               current working directory).

               For example:

               % cc -I. -I yourdir mydir/b.c

               The preceding command line produces the following search
               order:

               1. mydir (#include "file" only).

               2. Current working directory, specified by -I.

               3. yourdir (relative to the current working directory),
                  specified by -I yourdir.

               4. Site-specific and compiler release-specific include files
                  directories.

               5. Directory /usr/include.

     -M        Provides information about recompilation dependencies that
               the source file invokes on #include files and other source
               files. This information is printed in the form expected by
               make. Such dependencies are introduced by the #include
               directive. The output is directed to stdout.

     -nostdinc Stops the preprocessor from searching for include files in
               the standard directory (/usr/include).

     -U macro  Removes any initial definition of macro. Any predefined
               macro except those required by the standard can be undefined
               by the -U option. The -U option overrides the -D option when
               the same macro name is specified, regardless of the order of
               options on the command line.

               Predefined macros are described in the Cray C and C++
               Reference Manual. Macros defined in the system headers are
               not predefined macros and are not affected by the -U option.

   Linker Options
     -h [system|default]_alloc
               The -h system_alloc option causes the compiler to use the
               native malloc implementation provided by the OS. By default,
               the compiler uses a modified malloc implementation which
               offers better support for Cray memory needs.

               In the CCS environment, -h default_alloc is not supported
               and the default is -h system_alloc.

               Default: default_alloc

     -h dynamic
               Directs the compiler driver to link dynamic libraries at
               runtime. This option is used to create dynamically linked
               executable files and may not be used with the -h static or
               -h shared options. Note that the preferred invocation is to
               call the generic cc command with the -dynamic option, rather
               than using this compiler specific option. See the cc(1) man
               page.

     -h [no]pgas_runtime
               The -h pgas_runtime option directs the compiler driver to
               link with the runtime libraries required when linking
               programs that use UPC, or coarrays. In general, aprun must
               be used to launch the resulting executable.

               The -hnopgas_runtime option prevents this runtime library
               environment from being added to the link line.

               Use the -hnopgas_runtime option when you have a program,
               that does not use UPC or coarrays, and you wish to execute
               it outside of the aprun/alps job launch context. For
               example, you may wish to test a serial program which does
               not contain any UPC or coarray code on a login or service
               node, or fork/exec an executable on a compute node. Also,
               compile non-coarray Fortran using the -hnocaf option.

               In the CCS environment -hpgas_runtime is not supported and
               -hnopgas_runtime is default.

               Default: pgas_runtime

     -h shared Creates a library which may be dynamically linked at
               runtime. Note that the preferred invocation is to call the
               generic cc command with the -shared option, rather than
               using this compiler specific option. See the cc(1) man page.

     -h static Directs the linker to use the static version of the
               libraries, not the dynamic version of the libraries, to
               create an executable file. Note that the preferred
               invocation is to call the generic cc command with the
               -static option. See the cc(1) man page.

     -l libname
               Directs the compiler driver to search for the specified
               object library file when linking an executable file. To
               request more than one library file, specify multiple -l
               options.

               When statically linking, the compiler driver searches for
               libraries by prepending ldir/lib on the front of libname and
               appending .a on the end of it, for each ldir that has been
               specified by using the -L option. It uses the first file it
               finds.

               When dynamically linking, the library search process is
               similar to the static case, with a few differences. The
               compiler driver searches for libraries by prepending
               ldir/lib on the front of libname and appending .so on the
               end of it, for each ldir that has been specified by using
               the -L option. If a matching .so is not found, the compiler
               driver replaces .so with .a and repeats the process from the
               beginning. It uses the first file it finds.

               There is no search order dependency for libraries.

               If you specify personal libraries by using the -l command
               line option, as in the following example, those libraries
               are added before the default CCE library list. (The -l
               option is passed to the linker.)

               % cc -l mylib target.c

               When the previous command line is issued, the linker looks
               for a library named libmylib.a (following the naming
               convention) and adds it to the top of the list of default
               libraries.

     -L ldir   Changes the -l option search algorithm to look for library
               files in directory ldir during link time. To request more
               than one library directory, specify multiple -L options.

               The linker searches for library files in the compiler
               release-specific directories.

               Note:  Multiple -L options are treated cumulatively as if
               all ldir arguments appeared on one -L option preceding all
               -l options. Therefore, do not attempt to link functions of
               the same name from different libraries through the use of
               alternating -L and -l options.

     -o outfile
               Produces an absolute binary file named outfile. A file named
               a.out is produced by default. When this option is used in
               conjunction with the -c option and a single source file, a
               relocatable object file named outfile is produced.

     files     The source files to be compiled or assembled. Valid file
               suffixes are .c and .i.

   Miscellaneous Options
     -h [no]acc
               Enables or disables the compiler recognition of OpenACC
               accelerator directives. The default is -h acc. For details,
               see Cray C and C++ Reference Manual, and the
               intro_openacc(7) man page.

     -h acc_model=option[:option] ...
               Explicitly control execution and memory model utilized by
               the accelerator support system. The option arguments
               identify the type of behavior desired. There are three
               option sets, only one member of a set may be used at a time;
               however, all three sets may be used together.

               Default: auto_async_kernel:fast_addr:no_deep_copy

               option Set 1:

               auto_async_none
                         Execute kernels and updates synchronously, unless
                         there is an async clause present on the kernels or
                         update directive.

               auto_async_kernel
                         Default. Execute all kernels asynchronously
                         ensuring program order is maintained.

               auto_async_all
                         Execute all kernels and data transfers
                         asynchronously, ensuring program order is
                         maintained.

               option Set 2:

               no_fast_addr
                         Use default types for addressing.

               fast_addr Default. Attempt to use 32 bit integers in all
                         addressing to improve performance. Base addresses
                         remain as 64 bit. The performance is improved by
                         potentially using fewer registers and faster
                         arithmetic for offset calculations. This
                         optimization may result in incorrect behavior for
                         codes that make use within accelerator regions of
                         any of the following: very large arrays (offsets
                         would require greater than 32 bits); very large
                         array lower bounds (max offset plus lower bound is
                         greater than 32 bits); bitfields/other bit
                         operations.

               option Set 3:

               no_deep_copy
                         Default. Do not look inside of an object type to
                         transfer sub-objects. Allocatable members of
                         derived type objects will not be allocated on the
                         device.

               deep_copy (Fortran only) Look inside of derived type objects
                         and recreate the derived type on the accelerator
                         recursively. A derived type object that contains
                         an allocatable member will have memory allocated
                         on the device for the member.

     -h cpu=target_system
               Specifies the target Cray system on which the absolute
               binary file is to be executed, where target_system can be
               either x86-64 or opteron (single or dual-core), barcelona or
               shanghai (quad-core), istanbul (6-core), mc8 (8-core), mc12
               (12-core), interlagos (16-core), interlagos-cu (8-compute
               unit), abudhabi (16-core), abudhabi-cu (8-compute unit),
               ivybridge, sandybridge, or haswell.

               The interlagos and abudhabi processors contain up to 8
               compute units, each of which contains two integer cores and
               a shared FPU. These targets assume that the user intends to
               run with one thread per core (up to 16 per processor), while
               the cpu-cu target assumes that the user intends to run with
               one thread per compute unit (up to 8 per processor or one
               thread per FPU).

               If target_system is set during compilation of any source
               file, it must be set to the same target during linking and
               loading.

               Rather than setting this option directly, users should load
               one of the targeting modules (craype-mc12 or craype-
               interlagos-cu, for example). The targeting modules set
               CRAY_CPU_TARGET and define paths to the corresponding
               libraries. The compiler driver script translates
               CRAY_CPU_TARGET to the corresponding cpu=target_system
               option when calling the compiler.

               If a user wishes to override the current target_system value
               set by the module environment (via the CRAY_CPU_TARGET
               definition), they should do so by specifying
               -hcpu=target_system on the compiler command line.

     -h [no]fp_trap
               Controls whether the compiler generates code compatible with
               floating point traps being enabled.

               Default: fp_trap, if traps are enabled using the -K trap
               option, or if -Ofp[0,1] is in effect. Otherwise, the default
               is nofp_trap.

     -h ident=name
               Changes the ident name to name. This name is used as the
               module name in the object file (.o suffix) and assembler
               file (.s suffix). Regardless of whether name is specified or
               the default is used, the following transformations are
               performed on name:

               ·  All . characters in the ident name are changed to $.

               ·  If the ident name starts with a number, a $ is added to
                  the beginning of the ident name.

               The default is the file name specified on the command line.

     -h list=opt
               Allows you to create listings and control their formats. The
               listings are written to source_file_name_without_suffix.lst.

               The values for opt are:

             --------------------------------------------------------------
             opt          Description
             --------------------------------------------------------------
             a            Use all list options;
                          source_file_name_without_suffix.lst includes
                          summary report, options report, and source
                          listing.
             d            Decompiles (translates) the intermediate
                          representation of the compiler into listings that
                          resemble the format of the source code. This is
                          performed twice, resulting in two output files,
                          at different points during the optimization
                          process. You can use these files to examine the
                          restructuring and optimization changes made by
                          the compiler, which can lead to insights about
                          changes you can make to your source code to
                          improve its performance.
                          The compiler produces two decompilation listing
                          files with these extensions per specified source
                          file: .opt and .cg. The compiler generates the
                          .opt file after applying most high-level loop
                          nest transformations to the code. The code
                          structure of this listing most resembles your
                          source code and is readable by most users. In
                          some cases, because of optimizations, the
                          structure of the loops and conditionals will be
                          significantly different than the structure in
                          your source file.
                          The .cg file contains a much lower level of
                          decompilation. It is quite close to what will be
                          produced as assembly output. This version
                          displays the intermediate text after all vector
                          translation and other optimizations have been
                          performed. An intimate knowledge of the hardware
                          architecture of the system is helpful to
                          understanding this listing.
                          The .opt and .cg files are intended as a tool for
                          performance analysis and are not valid source
                          code. The format and contents of the files can be
                          expected to change from release to release.
             e            Expand include files.
                          Using this option may result in a very large
                          listing file. All system include files are also
                          expanded.
             i            Intersperse optimization messages within the
                          source listing rather than at the end.
             m            Create loopmark listing;
                          source_file_name_without_suffix.lst includes
                          summary report and source listing.
             s            Create a complete source listing (include files
                          not expanded).
             T            Retains file.T after processing rather than
                          deleting it.
             --------------------------------------------------------------

     -h [no]memory_alloc_intrinsics
               Enables or disables compiler recognition and replacement of
               the malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), and free() memory
               allocation routines with calls to intrinsics. The default is
               -hmemory_alloc_intrinsics

     -h network=nic
               Specifies the target machine's system interconnection
               network. Currently, the supported values for nic are gemini
               and aries.

     -h nodwarf
               Disables DWARF generation during compilation. By default,
               DWARF source line information is generated to support
               traceback analysis. Use this option to disable the
               generation of DWARF source line information. This option has
               no affect if -g or -G dbg_opt is specified.

     -h [no]omp
               Enables or disables compiler recognition of OpenMP
               directives. If -O0 is specified, then -h noomp is implied.
               The default is -h omp.

     -h pic, -h PIC
               Generates position independent code (PIC), which allows a
               virtual address change from one process to another, as is
               necessary in the case of shared, dynamically linked objects.
               The virtual addresses of the instructions and data in PIC
               code are not known until dynamic link time.

     -h prototype_intrinsics
               Simulates the effect of including intrinsics.h at the
               beginning of a compilation. Use this option if the source
               code does not include the intrinsics.h statement and you
               cannot modify the code. This option is off by default.

     -h [no]threadsafe
               Enables or disables the generation of threadsafe code. Code
               that is threadsafe can be used with pthreads and OpenMP.

               C code compiled with -h threadsafe (the default) cannot be
               linked with C code compiled with -h nothreadsafe.

               The default is -h threadsafe.

     -h upc    Enables compilation of Unified Parallel C (UPC) code. UPC is
               a C language extension for parallel program development that
               allows you to explicitly specify parallel programming
               through language syntax rather than through library
               functions such as are used in MPI or SHMEM. For details on
               supported UPC functions, see the Cray C and C++ Reference
               Manual.

               In the CCS environment, -hupc is not supported.

               This option is off by default.

     -K trap=opt[,opt] ...
               Enable traps for the specified exceptions. By default, no
               exceptions are trapped. Enabling traps using this option
               also has the effect of setting -h fp_trap.

               If the specified options contradict each other, the last
               option has priority. For example, -Ktrap=none,fp is
               equivalent to -Ktrap=fp.

               This option does not affect compile time optimizations; it
               detects runtime exceptions. This option is processed only at
               link time and affects the entire program; it is not
               processed when compiling subprograms. Therefore, traps may
               be set using this command line option at the beginning of
               execution of the main program only. The program may
               subsequently change these settings by calling intrinsic or
               library procedures. Use of this option may require the
               specification of -hfp_trap when compiling other files of the
               application.

               opt       Exceptions

               denorm    Trap on denormalized operands.

               divz      Trap on divide-by-zero.

               fp        Trap on divz, inv, or ovf exceptions.

               inexact   Trap on inexact result (i.e. rounded result).
                         Enabling traps for inexact results is not
                         recommended.

               inv       Trap on invalid operation.

               none      Disables all traps (default).

               ovf       Trap on overflow (i.e. the result of an operation
                         is too large to be represented).

               unf       Trap on underflow (i.e. the result of an operation
                         is too small to be represented).

     -V        Displays compiler version information. If the command line
               specifies no source file, no compilation occurs. Version
               information consists of the product name, the version
               number, and the current date and time.

     -X  npes  Specifies the number of processing elements (PEs) that will
               be specified through aprun at job launch. The value for npes
               can range from 1 through 2**31 - 1 inclusive on Cray
               systems.

               Ensure that you compile all object files with the same -X
               npes value and run the resulting executable with that number
               of PEs. If you use mixed -X  npes values or if the number of
               PEs provided at run time differs from the -X npes value, a
               run time error is generated.

               The number of PEs to use cannot be changed at link or run
               time. You must recompile the program with a different value
               for npes to change the number of PEs.

#pragma DIRECTIVES
     For a description of #pragma directives, including OpenMP, OpenACC,
     and UPC directives, see the Cray C and C++ Reference Manual and the
     intro_pragmas(1), and intro_openacc(7) man pages.

COMPILE TIME ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
     For compile time, run time, and OpenMP environment variables, refer to
     the Cray C and C++ Reference Manual.

FILES
     By default, the compilation process creates an absolute binary file
     named a.out that reflects the contents of the source files and any
     referenced library functions. File a.out can then be executed on the
     target compute nodes. The compiler commands accept several types of
     file arguments, as explained in the following paragraphs.

     The cc command interprets files with .c or .i suffixes as C source
     files. The source files are compiled, and each corresponding object
     code is left in a file whose name is that of the source file, with .o
     substituted for the previous suffix. If no options are selected to
     control the compilation process, the cc command automatically calls
     the linker. The linker uses file.o as input and produces the
     executable file.

     Files whose names end with .s are interpreted as assembly language
     source files. They are assembled, and each corresponding object code
     is left in a file. The file name is that of the source file, with .o
     substituted for .s. Again, the linker uses file.o as input and
     produces the executable file.

     Any compatible object files whose names end with .o, plus files whose
     names end with no suffix or a suffix other than those mentioned above
     (for example, file.a), are passed to the linker (in the order
     specified on the command line) to produce the executable file.

     With the use of appropriate options, compilation can be terminated
     early to produce one of several intermediate translations, including
     object files (-c option), assembly source expansions for C code (-S
     option), or the output of the preprocessor phase of the compiler (-P
     and -E options). In general, the intermediate files can be saved and
     later resubmitted to the cc command, with other files or libraries
     included as necessary.

     The following summarizes the files used by the C compiler:

     --------------------------------------------------------------
     File Name    Description
     --------------------------------------------------------------
     a.out        Default name of the executable output file
     file.a       Library input file
     file.c       C source file
     file.i       Preprocessor output file
     file.L       Pseudo-CAL listing file
     file.o       Object file
     file.s       Assembly language source file
     file.V       Report file for -h report
     --------------------------------------------------------------
